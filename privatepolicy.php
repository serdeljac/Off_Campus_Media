		<h2>NOTE: This private policy is NOT valid for Off Campus Media and is not inforced by any law!</h2>

		<div class=group><h4>Our Privacy Commitment</h4>
			<p>At Off Campus Media we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are 
			shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping 
			with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and 
			disclosure of your personal information.</p>

			<p>This Policy applies to our retail stores, our Web Sites, and all other channels in which Off Campus Media 
			collects and uses your personal information.</p>
		</div>
		
		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>What Information does Off Campus Media Collect?</h4>
			<p>At Off Campus Media, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. 
			The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.</p>
		</div>

		<div class=group><h4>Personal information</h4>
			<p>Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable 
			individual. We may collect personal information such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>your contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
				<li>your personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and</li>
				<li>your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit 
					card number.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Non-personal information</h4>
			<p>Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;</li>
				<li>we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are 
					using or the referring URL; or</li>
				<li>we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and 
					research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest 
					entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All references to "Web Sites" in this Privacy Policy mean www.offcampusmedia.ca, www.geeksquad.ca, or other Off 
			Campus Media provided Web sites.</p>

			<p>You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be 
			able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you 
			a Off Campus Media credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>How is Your Personal Information Used?</h4>
			<p>Off Campus Media may use your personal information for a number of different business purposes, for example to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fulfill orders and requests for products, services or information;</li>
				<li>process returns, exchanges and layaway requests;</li>
				<li>detect and protect against fraud and error;</li>
				<li>establish and manage your accounts with us;</li>
				<li>track and confirm online orders;</li>
				<li>deliver or install products;</li>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Your Consent</h4>
			<p>Off Campus Media will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and 
			consent, except where required or permitted by law. When you choose to provide us with your personal information 
			you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further 
			identified at the time of collection.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Information Off Campus Media Collects Directly from You</h4>
			<p>Listed here are some further examples of the ways that we collect personal information directly from you and 
			how we use it.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>In-Store Purchases</h4>
			<p>When you purchase a Off Campus Media product or service, you may need to provide us with contact and payment 
			information (such as credit card information) so that we can process your request or complete your transaction. 
			Examples where we need contact information include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, 
			and extended warranty coverage.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Returns and Exchanges</h4>
			<p>Our goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, Off Campus Media 
			offers a Return Policy. For Off Campus Media to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal 
			information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud 
			and error, or to communicate with you regarding your return or exchange, if necessary. You may also be asked to 
			produce photo ID for verification purposes only.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Applying for the Off Campus Media Credit Card</h4>
			<p>When you apply for a Off Campus Media credit card, certain contact and financial information is collected and 
			reviewed by our credit card provider, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ("Chase"), to approve, establish and maintain credit 
			card accounts. Chase has its own privacy policy, which governs its relationship with you. We also encourage you 
			to read their privacy statement provided with your credit card application.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>ReClaim Insurance Replacement</h4>
			<p>When working with our ReClaim Consultants to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we 
			will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your 
			claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for 
			you.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys</h4>
			<p>Following a purchase from some of our departments we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your 
			business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or 
			installation of your new product.</p>

			<p>We may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional 
			surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to 
			participate.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Our Web Sites</h4>
			<p>Our Web Sites can be browsed anonymously. However, to engage in certain special features or functions of our 
			Web Sites, or to order products and services from our Web Sites, you may be asked to provide certain personal 
			information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information. We 
			use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your 
			inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as Customer Reviews.</p>

			<p>If you choose to ship an order to a third party, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all 
			necessary consents from the third party to permit Off Campus Media to collect, use, and disclose the third 
			party’s personal information for the purposes of fraud prevention and processing and shipping the order.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Customer Reviews</h4>
			<p>The Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to share your 
			thoughts on a product. These reviews are accessible to all Web Site visitors so please use discretion when 
			posting information to them and do not post personal information.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates</h4>
			<p>Off Campus Media offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications. You may choose to stop 
			receiving these communications at any time. Each marketing or promotional email we send to you will include a 
			link or other method to quickly and easily unsubscribe and decline further similar emails.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Participate in a Contest or Promotion</h4>
			<p>From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact 
			information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences). Personal 
			information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For 
			research and analysis purposes, we may also summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer 
			identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules 
			that will be available with each particular campaign. Some contests are conducted by third parties and will be 
			subject to the third party’s policies.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Email a Friend</h4>
			<p>While visiting our Web Sites you may choose to use the "Email a Friend" tool which allows you to inform a 
			friend about products of interest to you. The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to 
			your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send 
			them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the "Email a Friend" 
			tool you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this 
			correspondence and not Off Campus Media. If you provide us with personal information concerning another 
			individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from 
			that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Reward Zone Membership</h4>
			<p>Loyalty and rewards programs, such as Reward Zone, include a component where we ask for your contact 
			information so we can administer the program. Your membership application information, information about your 
			transactions and redemptions, and any other information you provide from time to time will be used to administer 
			your membership, communicate with you about your membership, and to better understand your preferences and 
			eligibility for Off Campus Media’s products and services. Membership in Reward Zone will result in certain 
			membership-related communications (such as notification of reward certificates, statement updates, and program 
			updates). On occasion, and with your consent, Off Campus Media may also use this information to provide you with 
			additional personalized marketing, notifications of sales and special events, and other exclusive member-only 
			offers. If you do not wish to receive these additional special offers and notifications, you may unsubscribe at 
			any time.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Subscription Services and Activations</h4>
			<p>Off Campus Media may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, 
			or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected 
			and provided to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular 
			carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so a government-issued ID number and your credit 
			card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.</p>
		</div>

		<a href="#" class="top">[top]</a>
		
		<div class=group><h4>Call Centres</h4>
			<p>Off Campus Media operates customer support call centres to accept and address your questions, concerns, or 
			complaints. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your 
			inquiry or to verify your identity. For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, 
			we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your 
			telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service 
			quality.</p>
		</div>
